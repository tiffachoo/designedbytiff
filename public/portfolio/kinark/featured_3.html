				<h3>ENHANCING COMMUNITY STRENGTHS TO RESPOND TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES</h3>

				<p><b>Communities working together to help children and families thrive.</b></p>
				<p>As the famous saying goes, "It takes a village to raise a child." But in this fast-paced world where many neighborhoods are characterized by high levels of unemployment, poverty, crime, social isolation, and other challenges, it's even more important to create a bond between families and connect them to community services that can help parents promote the health and well-being of children and youth.</p>
				<p>The Kinark Foundation supports an innovative solution to this challenge. Offered at the Kinark Outdoor Centre, Neighbourhood Family Programs utilize a three-day recreational getaway, and the planning process around it, as an opportunity for families from disadvantaged neighbourhoods to develop support networks, address community issues and create linkages with local schools and service providers.</p>
				<p>Research has found that lack of adequate finances makes families more susceptible to high levels of chronic stress related to meeting basic needs such as food, housing, clothing and child care. Some consequences of living with high stress include: increase in illness, depression, relationship breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, and spousal and child abuse.</p>
				<p>Low-income living contributes to greater social isolation and creates barriers to accessing mainstream support services and participating in community activities. Lack of trust and other obstacles often get in the way of parents being involved with their children's school, thus missing a critical opportunity to support their children's healthy development and receive help with other needs.</p>
				<p>The goal of the Neighbourhood Family Program is to strengthen communities with high numbers of "working poor" families by providing a positive shared experience and creating connections between families, schools and community service providers. Participants take part in a structured and supported social-recreational experience with the focus on fun and positive interaction. The long weekend offers an outdoor experience similar to families going on vacation. But for many low-income families, this is their first opportunity to participate in a family vacation where they can enjoy each other's company away from the trials of everyday life. Each family has its own cabin, meals are provided at a central dining facility, and there is an array of outdoor recreational activities such as water sports in the summer or snow shoeing in the winter. Comprehensive information sharing happens with a strong support structure in place and parents benefit from receiving some respite from their caregiving role. Most groups build in one facilitated meeting for the adults during the three-day period where they can have a focused discussion of issues concerning the group.</p>
				<p>The final part of the program takes place back in the neighborhood. It includes identifying action items coming out of the experience, organizing support groups, information gathering, connecting with community services, and a special celebration day. In one Neighborhood Family Program, the group developed strategies to create effective linkages with the police to reduce crime in their community; in another program, participants worked together to see their dream of building a playground realized. In all cases, developing social support networks serves as a protective factor leading to reduced mental illness and preventing the need for more intrusive and costly interventions. Neighbourhood Family Programs also empower parents to better support their children's healthy social and emotional development.</p>
				<p>Neighbourhood Family Programs have been successfully implemented with several communities in southern Ontario and the demand is high to bring this program to other children and youth and their parents.</p>
